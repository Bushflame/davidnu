          p Hi, I'm David, I created and administer this program for the benefit of N.U.D.S. students. 
          p While I do use a free version of Google's G Suite, I don't use Google Classroom. I found it too cumbersome and restrictive.
          P This website is the early stages. I hope to add more pages and probably extra guidance. 
          p If you have any questions about how everything operates, please don't hesitate to contact me using one of the methods at the bottom of the page.
          p Regards<br/> ฝรั่งหล่อ
        .about 
          p I'm going to be teaching you mainly academic English, along with a range of idioms. I'll be providing useful stock phrases which you can use in a variety of contexts. 
          p My aim is to provide you with a wide range of vocabulary. For this reason I've chosen project based teaching, so you'll also be learning the fundementals of a range of topics.
          p All modules are flexible, so if there any aspects of the English language you need help with, please ask and I will add them. We can work together to provide better courses for you and future generations

          p I provide and demonstrate 5 or 6 pieces of vocabulary. Each team provides examples of the given phrase in any context. For this part you are graded as a class. You can see other responses and also add comments if you think improvements can be made. You should all work together.

            h4  Throughout our adult life there are times when we need to help and support others. We must also understand that our performance affects those around us
          p The approach I take deals with both these scenarios. 10% of your total grade with depend upon how well all of your team perform in the individual tests. So what does this do?

            h4 Some students give up before they even start or are afraid to ask for help when they needed. Sometimes a little push is all they need
          p Knowing that others are depending on them could be all they need. Otherwise they can ask their team mates. None of us are super human, we all need help at sometime. Hopefully; knowing if you fail, your team fails will encourage you to do better.

            h4 Not many people forget a helping hand. Helping someone when they neeed it could pay you back many times over in the future.
          p Advanced learners: here's a chance for you to develop your leadership skill by taking charge of your group. I strongly advise you to help others, rather than just do the assignments for them. Remember, if your team mates fail, you fail!

          p We all have strengths and weaknesses. Not being good in a specific area is nothing to be ashamed of. In a team we all help each other. A good team is always greater than the sum of its parts.

          p I want students to be proud of themselves for achieving grade 4 in my subject. Cheating devalues the grade of every honest student and lowers the perceived standards of the school. Instead of trying to improve the learning experience, I am having to waste time trying to prevent cheating. This means because a few students cheat, every student suffers.
          p cheating will result in suspension of grade until parents have given their assurance it will not happen again. The student will also be downgraded.
