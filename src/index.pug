          h3 title
          p I teach English as a second language to students of high school level prior to them entering university. Along with everyday phrases, usable in an academic context, I aim to give them a wide vocabulary based around subjects they intend to study at university. 
          p With a mixture of whole class, small groups, and individual assignments, I find I'm able to advance at a much quicker pace. Topics I have prepared, or am preparing include...

          h3 account creation
          p I'll begin by giving you access to a spreadsheet for you to add your details in English. Your login details will be: nickname + initials + @davidnu.com. Your password, which you must change, will be your student ID number.
          p Once I’ve have created your accounts I’ll provide your login details. Then I’ll share two dropboxes with you. One for every class (e.g. M5 Dropbox) and the other for your class (e.g. M5.1 Dropbox)
          p You'll then form groups and choose one of the team names I give you. Each class will have 6 teams of 6 or 7 students

          h3 dropboxes
          p In the “class” dropbox you’ll find the workbook for submitting your tasks. I may add other files specific to your class later.
          p In the “year” dropbox you’ll find a grade sheet. This will be automatically updated every time you complete a class, team or oral component. There’ll also be a course document with all the assignment details. I will add other files, such as midterm and final notes, later.
          p Obviously you’ll only be able to edit the assignments file, the rest you will only be allowed to view. Please note the shitlist which lists you behavior and is going to be made accessible to your parents

          h3 course modules
          p Each course is divided into a number of four part modules. The first two are class and team assignments. The third tests you for fluency and accuracy of the vocabulary. The fourth is gotcha for any student hoping to rely on their team mates for a higher grade.

          h3 part 1: phrases
          p I provide and demonstrate 5 or 6 pieces of vocabulary. Each team provides examples of the given phrase in any context. For this part you are graded as a class. You can see other responses and also add comments if you think improvements can be made. You should all work together.

          h3 part 2: topic
          p After the lecture each team responds with a given scenario. Scoring is on a team basis. Bonus for the best answers and “Team of the Month” awards may be available.

          h3 part 4: multiplier test
          p An individual test where you are required to use the phrases from part one in the context of the topic. The score from this is used to multiply the scores from parts 1 and 2. This ensures a fairer grade. The test is online and marked automatically

          h3 Oral multiplier
          p *To prevent a “read, speak, forget” scenario in the regular oral tests, at the end of the semester you need to speak 4 random phrases, of my choosing, from the entire vocabulary list. The score for this test is used to multiply the earlier scores.
